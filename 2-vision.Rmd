# Statement of vision for education in statistics and data science

- what "educational leadership" (EL) means to you and what EL you might pursue in the future. Vision for long-term career growth towards Prof of Teaching, even if it's tentative.
	- Existing examples:
		- Curriculum development of 551 throughout the years; 561 w/ Gaby and Sunny, later Tom; 531; 511?; 563; BAIT 509; 562; STAT 545A/547M.
		- Arrangement of (mostly) statistical concepts as they relate to data science on a whole-program level. 
	- Promise: distplyr?
	- Promise: Promotion of distributional forecasting methods.
	- Promise: Host conference
	- teaching, mentorship and inspiration of colleagues: post-docs, Sunny, TA's for guest lecture.
	- Making resources public: 551, 545A/547M (expanded from Jenny's work).

<!-- EL = an activity taken at UBC and elsewhere to advance innovation in teaching and learning with impact beyond oneâ€™s classroom -->

- Service to the academic profession, to the University, and to the community: 
	- BGC project (important to stay relevant with pressing issues, and to bring industry experience to the program)
	- MDS vision statement
	- Blog post?
	- ASDa workshops in 2017.

Responsible use

[ ] Sharing the teaching: I like to give my TA's the opportunity to deliver a guest lecture. I'll guide them beforehand, and have a "debrief" session, usually a walk outside (inspired from ISW).
