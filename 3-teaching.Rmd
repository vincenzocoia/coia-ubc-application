## Teaching

<!-- must provide evidence for excellence in, and commitment to, undergraduate teaching;  -->

<!-- I imagine this section to be on how I go about teaching -->


My teaching takes to heart what I learned from Greg Wilson, that teaching is much more about motivating students than it is knowledge transfer. Students have access to any information they want through the internet, but a classroom environment has the powerful advantage of the presence of peers and a knowledgeable instructor. I'm pleased to that I consistently get feedback from students and peers that my enthusiasm is contagious in the classroom. I do love the material I teach. 

__Structured teaching__. [ ] Learning objectives to guide content creation, lab creation, and quiz creation.
[ ] Clearly defining expectations, and clearly and constantly reminding everyone what we've talked about and why regarding the big structure of the course.

This is because you're not equipped with the clarity of what material is most appropriate and how to most appropriately deliver it, until you are delivering or have delivered it. As they say, hindsight is 20-20

Although structure is important in teaching, it can also stymie your course if taken overboard or held too tightly. This is because, when preparing material, you're not equipped with the clarity of how to appropriately deliver the material until you are delivering or have delivered it. For example, a question for the class might have seemed insightful when you prepared it, but maybe during class the students aren't confused by it at all. Or, maybe you've underestimated the time it will take to deliver some material. The answer to addressing this issue is __responsive teaching__ and performing an __after-action review__.

If the student cohort has roughly the same skills and knowledge year-to-year, the course content has been perfected and is not evolving, and your teaching is consistently flawless, there might not be much (if anything) to respond to. But that's not me, and it's not data science.

After-action review: As they say, hindsight is 20-20. It's important to reflect and record insights so that the course can be improved for the following year. There are three ways I engage in this activity. First, I capture course-related insight frequently throughout a course while my insights are still fresh. I generally like to ask myself "what went well?" and "what didn't, and how could I have done this differently?". I record these as GitHub Issues so that they can easily be referred to in the future, and are accessible to my colleagues and future members of the teaching team. Secondly, I also find keeping a teaching journal that's not tied to a specific course is appropriate for becoming a better teacher in general. Entries here are less frequent, and usually higher level. Thirdly, my colleagues and I engage in a "retreat" at the end of each term, to discuss our insight on our courses and the MDS program as a whole. This results in action items.

__Responsive teaching__.  Feedback I take a semi-spontaneous approach to teaching, as inspired by improv comedy -- I have a rough guideline that I abide to, but am not afraid to deviate from this where necessary, responding to how the class is feeling about a topic. I use various methods to keep constant awareness of how the class is feeling, through simple methods such as asking questions, to more modern active learning strategies such as think-pair-share, which leverages the knowledge of peers.
	- [ ] Responsive teaching (address points of confusion that I notice from slack and labs in lecture; dont bother with think pair share if the answers are unanimous.)

__Active learning techniques__: parsons problems, think-pair-share, live coding. 

__Community__: stay in touch through weekly academic meetings, lunches, and slack; giving and receiving peer feedback on their teaching is also useful for improving.

Connecting with the students: I no longer hold my office hours in my office, because the office hour model of students dropping by to ask a question and then leave is just not effective. There ends up being a queue of students, usually asking common questions, and these students feel pressured to leave so that others can get a turn. Instead, I hold my office hours in a lab-like room suitable for collaboration. I end up leading a whole-group discussion prompted by student questions. This also gives me even more insight as to how things are going in class, and allows me the opportunity to modify the course moving forward. I also like to keep an eye on the course Slack channel to provide more insight, as well as talking to students during the mid-class break or after class about questions they may have. During class, I like to pause to check for insight in the class.


One thing I struggle with are student names. I feel embarrassed to use names because I'm sure to make mistakes, some probably quite embarrassing. But calling students by their name is important because it shows that the instructor cares. I already review class lists, but intend to step outside of my comfort zone by no longer avoiding using names. 

## Training

<!-- must provide evidence for ability to work collaboratively as well as independently, and to supervise the work of others -->

- Respecting people's time: giving subordinates the option of meeting electronically if they choose.
- Making clear everyone's role in a team project (example: 561 project, capstone projects)
- and getting a sense of the amount of time/involvement each person will be contributing.
- Delegation levels, and being open to letting go (sometimes it's difficult because we want to take ownership)
	- Also, I believe that we don't delegate enough. As a result, we end up sacrificing valuable time where instead we could be really moving the needle in our program.
- Staying mindful of the potential of subconscious discrimination coming about by showing preference of some team members over others, whether it be race, gender, personality, skillset, etc. This means being deliberate about where I spend my attention.
- Feedback: taking the time to provide feedback for one's work. I believe this shows respect for the other person, that they are worth my time, and provides an impetus for them to improve. Example: 561 labs 3 and 4 with Tom; detailed feedback on pieces of writing submitted by students (capstone).
- I try to be genuine so that they can see that I'm also a human that makes mistakes and has gaps in my skillset, and lead a regular life outside of UBC. I think this also helps develop a stream of open communication for questions, concerns, and how things are going. Creating a culture that's safe for dissent, because my subordinates have skills, knowledge, and a viewpoint that I don't have, and from which I can learn from them.
- One thing I need to improve upon for this coming capstone, as reflected in my evaluations, is to be more mindful of group dynamics. Even if things between me and each team member/student are fine, relationships between other team members/students might not be. This year, I'll be meeting with each student individually to see how things are going.
