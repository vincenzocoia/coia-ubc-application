# Cover Letter

hyperlinks to one or two examples of my teaching materials. Note that I don't see any of these as being "finished", but rather a work-in-progress.

- For STAT 545A/547M (Exploratory Data Analysis), I made the [lecture notes](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.com/) and [course website](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/). Less relevant are Lectures 11+, taught by Dr. Firas Moosvi, and Lecture 6, a guest lecture taught by my TA, Victor Yuan.
- For DSCI 551 (Probability for Data Science), I wrote the [lecture notes](https://ubc-mds.github.io/DSCI_551_stat-prob-dsci/lectures/) by using Dr. Mike Gelbart's notes from the previous year as scaffolding.
- I'm writing an open-source book on regression analysis for data science, called [Interpreting Regression](https://interpreting-regression.netlify.com/). It's in its early stages.
