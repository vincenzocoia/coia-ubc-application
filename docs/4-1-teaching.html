<!-- must provide evidence for excellence in, and commitment to, undergraduate teaching;  -->
<!-- I imagine this section to be on how I go about teaching -->
<p>You and I don’t really know English. We only know enough of it to be a sufficiently useful tool for our own daily activities. I take this concept to heart as I design and deliver my courses. It’s fallacious to design a course around <em>topics</em>, but rather on building <em>skills</em> for a certain purpose. To me, these skills formulated as a list of <strong>learning objectives</strong> make up the course’s purpose, and so provides focus. For example, course content on the topic “heteroskedasticity” could be developed in many directions. The students, thinking they have to “know heteroskedasticity”, get stuck studying its never-ending scope. Instead, a learning objective such as “modify a linear model to appropriately incorporate heteroskedasticity based on data diagnostics” provides direction for the teaching team, and clarity for the students. Clarity for the students equips them with a map of what they need to do to succeed. It’s important to deliberately structure both course material and summative assessments towards these learning objectives, like a compass pointing north.</p>
<p>Speaking of structure, too much of it can stymie your course if taken overboard or held too tightly. This is because, when preparing material, you’re not equipped with the clarity of how to most appropriately deliver material until it has been delivered. For example, a question for the class might have seemed insightful when you prepared it, but maybe during class the students aren’t confused by it at all. Or, maybe you’ve underestimated the time it will take to deliver some material. The answer to addressing this issue is <strong>responsive teaching</strong>.</p>
<p>Responsive teaching to me is about staying in touch with the class to get a feel for areas that need more or less attention. For example, it means: taking a break when the energy of the class is low; responding to class confusion by explaining something in a different way on the whiteboard; or spending more or less time on something after realizing its importance mid-class. In this way, teaching is more akin to improv comedy, where actors must respond to random cues from the audience. Addressing this need in teaching requires letting go and trusting in yourself to respond appropriately in the moment, but also to be humble when you don’t know something (which in fact builds trust). Spontaneity sometimes also requires realizing and appropriately acting on your agency in adapting a course. Understanding that a course is flexible allows you to be nimble during contact hours with students, as opposed to feeling stuck in delivering the course exactly as it was originally laid out. It’s important to try to make changes for what’s to come as opposed to what’s already passed, but we can’t always, in which case it’s important to inform the students of any changes and why. I like doing so at the start of class while I give an overview of where we are in the course and where we’re going.</p>
<p>I use various methods to keep constant awareness of how the class is feeling and connecting with the students. I use simple methods such as asking questions, to more modern active learning strategies such as think-pair-share, which leverages the knowledge of peers. Also, at the start of each class, I like to check in to see how things are going. I’ll ask questions like “how are we feeling about the quiz coming up next week?”, or “how are we feeling this week?”, which tend to be successful. I no longer hold my office hours in my office, because the office hour model of students dropping by to ask a question and then leave is just not effective. There ends up being a queue of students, usually asking common questions, and these students feel pressured to leave so that others can get a turn. Instead, I hold my office hours in a lab-like room suitable for collaboration. I end up leading a whole-group discussion prompted by student questions. This also gives me even more insight as to how things are going in class, and allows me the opportunity to modify the course moving forward. I also like to keep an eye on the course Slack channel to provide more insight, as well as talking to students during the mid-class break or after class about questions they may have. During class, I like to pause to check for insight in the class.</p>
<p>When it comes to my actual delivery in class, my teaching takes to heart what I learned from Greg Wilson, that teaching is much more about motivating students than it is knowledge transfer. Students have access to any information they want through the internet, but a classroom environment has the powerful advantage of the presence of peers and a knowledgeable instructor. On the teaching front, this means being enthusiastic (it means something different for structuring the course, as I elaborate on in my vision for education in statistics). I’m pleased to that I consistently get feedback from students and peers that my enthusiasm is contagious in the classroom. I do love the material I teach. <strong>Active learning techniques</strong>: parsons problems, think-pair-share, live coding.</p>
<p>I believe the bigger theme of providing clarity about the course empowers the students, because they know what they have to do to succeed. As mentioned, providing learning objectives and their importance in summative assessments is part of providing clarity, but so is providing a detailed course syllabus and discussing it at the start of the course.</p>
<p>Improving my teaching involves <strong>community engagement</strong> and <strong>after-action reviews</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong>: stay in touch through weekly academic meetings, lunches, and slack; giving and receiving peer feedback on their teaching is also useful for improving.</p>
<p>An after-action review is a reflection after delivering material. As they say, hindsight is 20-20. Capturing this insight is a very effective way of improving a course, either for next year or mid-delivery. There are three ways I engage in an after-action review. First, I capture regular insight throughout the delivery of the course as GitHub Issues, so that they can easily be referred to in the future and by any of my colleagues. Secondly, I find keeping a teaching journal that’s not tied to a specific course is useful for becoming a better teacher in general. Entries here are less frequent, and usually higher level. Thirdly, my colleagues and I engage in a “retreat” at the end of each term, to discuss our insight on our courses and the MDS program as a whole. All three of these methods are powerful ways to improve.</p>
<p>One thing I struggle with are student names. I feel embarrassed to use names because I’m sure to make mistakes, some probably quite embarrassing. But calling students by their name is important because it shows that the instructor cares. I already review class lists, but intend to step outside of my comfort zone by no longer avoiding using names.</p>
<p>Another thing I struggle with is writing in an orderly fashion on the whiteboard. I use the whiteboard for spontaneity / responsive teaching, which means I don’t know how I’ll ultimately be using the board throughout the class. I end up running out of space, and end up using the board in a non-linear fashion, which can sometimes be confusing. For now, I intend to remain mindful of this and keep practicing.</p>
<p>In summary, to me, teaching is about setting a clear purpose of the course through learning objectives, which should guide all aspects of the course. Making way for student success requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>responding appropriately to their needs by embracing some spontaneity in the classroom, being humble, and sometimes modifying the course as appropriate.</li>
<li>keeping an open dialogue with the students.</li>
<li>providing motivation and enthusiasm instead of knowledge transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improving my own teaching involves reflecting in an after-action review, and staying engaged with my colleagues who are also teaching.</p>
