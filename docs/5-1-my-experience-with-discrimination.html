<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> My experience with discrimination</h2>
<p>As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I continue to experience discrimination. Me and my male partner holding hands in public still forms a spectacle to many, some even stopping to watch us after we’ve walked by. Wedding vendors still referring to a “bride” when mentioning our wedding. Being invited to a wedding under the condition that my partner and I show no affection.</p>
<p>Things were worse in my adolescence, where homosexuality was “discouraged” in my environment, leaving me feeling socially out of place and fearful. Luckily, very few extended family members have a problem with my identity, and the rest embrace me.</p>
<p>Even though I’m a cis male, I’m quite passionate about gender issues, because they are largely not being embraced by our society, and because we’re all affected by it (although transgendered and non-binary people are affected on an entirely different level).</p>
<p>To me, any type of brainwashing is deplorable, yet gender brainwashing is ubiquitous. You won’t find a pink yoga mat in the men’s section.</p>

<p>The solution to gender discrimination does not involve abolishing the notion of gender altogether, because gender has been proven to be important to humanity. Solution is about rather identifying a spectrum for which the extremes might be called “masculine” and “feminine”.</p>

<p>Fatherhood. Nice article on the bias: <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/families/mom-bias-in-the-parenting-community-why-is-there-no-discussion-about-it-wcz/" class="uri">https://goodmenproject.com/families/mom-bias-in-the-parenting-community-why-is-there-no-discussion-about-it-wcz/</a>
Nice article on involved dads reaching similar levels of oxytocin with involved moms: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/your-brain-fatherhood-dads-experience-hormonal-changes-too-research-shows-6C10333109" class="uri">https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/your-brain-fatherhood-dads-experience-hormonal-changes-too-research-shows-6C10333109</a>, which has one line that stands out when it comes to bias:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rilling said the study of the fatherhood effect is a “wide open frontier.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you may know, my partner and I recently had a child through surrogacy. But, on the delivery day, the hospital was not prepared to handle a situation with two dads. It’s important for the parents to form a bond with their child, and to help the surrogate avoid attachment issues with the child – but the (well-intentioned) hospital staff overlooked both of these aspects. We (the parents) were supposed to be brought in as soon as the baby was born, for initial skin-to-skin contact, but the hospital staff didn’t bring us in until an hour after birth. Furthermore, they gave our surrogate first skin-to-skin contact – this promotes oxytocin in the surrogate, making it more difficult to part with the child, and denies the parents the opportunity for initial bonding. Worse, hospital staff kept referring to our surrogate as “mom”, and referred to our son by her last name. Not only is this disrespectful for the parents, but it makes separation even more difficult for the surrogate.</p>
<p>In fact, there is an overarching issue of dads not being regarded as equally important figures as moms. Worse, this issue gets almost no attention. Moms are paraded as the caregivers, whereas dads are just there for support and don’t deserve much say in parenthood. Just about anything to do with parenthood refers to mom – for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>we could not find a book about parenthood that does not emphasize mom’s role;</li>
<li>parenthood groups emphasize women over men, such as Facebook groups and community centers.</li>
<li>marketing. Companies like 4Moms is akin to a business supply brand being called “4Businessmen”.</li>
<li>Even scientific research</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this hasn’t been socially recognized as an issue yet, in mentioning it, I risk sounding androcentric. This cannot be further from the truth. I recognize that women are far more marginalized than men are, and I fully embrace empowerment of women. Groups like R Ladies need support; I’m proud of the fact that we pay close attention to the amount of women we accept in the MDS program; and I’m no stranger to calling out</p>

What happened yesterday should serve as a reminder that, more than ever, we need women in politics. Some people clearly want to chase women out of politics, but that's not going to make anything better. This isn't going to chase me out — it's going to make me work even harder. <a href="https://t.co/HJ0qyoiFhm">pic.twitter.com/HJ0qyoiFhm</a>
