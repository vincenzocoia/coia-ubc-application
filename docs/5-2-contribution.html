<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Contribution</h2>
<p>To me, contributing to inclusivity is about creating an inclusive environment, especially when it comes to making course content; calling out discrimination, even when the discrimination is unintentional; and being a role model for others by being comfortable about who I am.</p>
<div id="creating-an-inclusive-environment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Creating an inclusive environment</h3>
<p>Involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing our language to be less presumptious. This means saying things such as “pregnant people” instead of “pregnant women”, referring to one’s “partner” instead of saying “wife” or “husband” (assuming a gender), not referring to someone by their race if not relevant (such as “I was talking to a Latino man the other day, …”).</li>
<li>Posting online content that suggest inclusivity. For example, not using data that indicates gender as binary (because it’s naive and ultimately untrue, even if gender is paraded as “sex”), and not indicating female:male ratios and parading naive terms such as “gender balanced” (because that’s naive too), but rather indicating percentage belonging to a minority group (such as “percent self-identifying as female”).</li>
<li>Removing spaces that discriminate by gender – this means a complete decoupling of bathrooms and gender (one should never have to say “I’m not allowed in this room because I’m a man/woman”). UBC needs to first take low-hanging fruit by abolishing gender from single-person bathrooms (like we have in the stats dept), then focus on root issues of multi-person bathrooms (which at first seem gender-related, but are actually not), such as an overall lack of privacy.</li>
<li>Disassociating identities with career roles.</li>
<li>Including a “covenant” or “code of conduct” in collaborative (and student) projects.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="calling-out-discrimination" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Calling out discrimination</h3>
<p>Means pointing out when non-inclusive language or behaviour is used, whether intentionally or not. Critically, this should be done with compassion, as opposed to accusation, because (1) people may not know any better, and (2) even if they do know better, this language can accidentally slip due to many years of belonging to a less-inclusive environment. Calling out discrimination can help educate people of the first type, as well as help re-program people of the second type. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone telling someone else that they’re in the “wrong bathroom”.</li>
<li>Example with MDS website, and bringing up issues in our academic meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Coming out” tells others that I’m proud of who I am, but also indicates sensitivity to issues of gender and sexual identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting my preferred personal pronouns (he/him/his) and a rainbow emoji online.</li>
<li>Posting a Positive Space sticker outside of my office.</li>
<li>Contributing my <a href="https://lgbtstem.wordpress.com/2019/11/09/an-interview-with-vincenzo-coia/">LGBTSTEM interview</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this, I’m hoping that others can feel safer around me, and that I inspire others to have pride in who they are as well. I also hope that it brings awareness to those who are not familiar with LGBTQ+ issues – for example, the more someone sees preferred personal pronouns being specified, the more likely they are to look up why more and more people are posting this and what this means.</p>
