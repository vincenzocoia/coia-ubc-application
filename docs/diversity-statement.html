<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Diversity Statement</h1>
<p>People deserve the same respect regardless of their identity. Any differential treatment is discrimination, and is problematic because it leaves people feeling disrespected, or worse, puts an impediment on one’s life. As an educational leader, awareness of issues is critical, so I begin by expressing some of my views. I myself and no stranger to discrimination, and I’d like to share some stories in the second section. Lastly, I end with my views of how I promote inclusivity.</p>
<div id="view" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> View</h2>
<p>Our society has made some great progress on inclusivity. Racial and sexual discrimination are significantly less these days compared to several decades ago. But the battle for these is still not over, as is evidenced by graffitied rainbow sidewalks and defaced mosques. Some discrimination is still rife, but are actively gaining awareness. For example, women are still underrepresented and dismissed in the workforce. Indigenous communities are still prone to lower quality of life.</p>
<p>Yet other types of discrimination are still not even well known. This includes gender discrimination, whereby we are all judged more than we know based on our gender. There is even less awareness on the issue of discrimination against fathers.</p>
<p>Not only is it healthy for each individual to receive respectful and equal treatment, we have so much to gain by having a diverse group of people around us. There’s strength in diversity.</p>
<div id="whats-the-discrimination-against-dads" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> What’s the discrimination against dads?</h3>
<p>It’s likely you haven’t heard of this one, so I think it’s worth elaborating. There is an overarching issue of dads not being regarded as equally important figures as moms. Just about anything to do with parenthood refers to mom – for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can’t find a book about parenthood that does not emphasize mom’s role;</li>
<li>Parenthood groups emphasize women over men, such as Facebook groups and community centers.</li>
<li>Products are marketed largely for mom. Companies like 4Moms is akin to a business supply brand being called “4Businessmen”.</li>
</ul>
<p>The discrimination is even built into <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/birth-adoption/births/birth-registration">BC policies regarding birth registration</a>. Three examples are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A dad is not allowed to register his child’s birth on his own, but a mom can.</li>
<li>A dad is not allowed to apply for MSP and Canada Child Benefits, but a mom can.</li>
<li>A dad is not allowed to be listed as primary caregiver without getting permission from the mom (if present), but a mom can list herself without permission of a present dad.</li>
</ol>
<p>This tells dads that they are only of secondary importance when it comes to child care, promoting a culture whereby dads don’t connect as intimately to their children. Worse, it also harms women’s ability to establish an equal presence in the workforce as men, due to the expectation that men need not expend as much energy on their child as women.</p>
<p>Even the notion of “primary caregiver” is discriminatory. Asking to identify such an individual is equivalent to asking “which parent is going to give less care to their child?”, which is of course very presumptuous, but also promotes a culture of unequal parenting, putting more pressure on one individual.</p>
<p>All of this is compounded in the situation where there’s no mom (i.e., two dads), or the situation where individuals don’t squarely identify as either male or female.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="my-experience-with-discrimination" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> My experience with discrimination</h2>
<p>As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I continue to experience discrimination. Me and my male partner holding hands in public still forms a spectacle to many, some even stopping to watch us after we’ve walked by. Wedding vendors still referring to a “bride” when mentioning our wedding. We’ve been invited to a wedding under the condition that we (specifically) show no affection (“for the sake of the children”).</p>
<p>Things were worse in my adolescence, where homosexuality was “discouraged” in my environment, leaving me feeling socially out of place and fearful. Luckily, very few extended family members have a problem with my identity, and the rest embrace me.</p>
<p>Although I’m a cis male, I’m passionate about gender issues. I once used the women’s washroom at the Whistler convention center, as an experiment and to test my confidence. The result were shrieks and gasps, gossip even outside of the washroom, and a closure of the women’s washroom until I left.</p>
<p>As you may know, my partner and I recently had a child through surrogacy. But, on the delivery day, the hospital was not prepared to handle a situation with two dads. It’s important for the parents to form a bond with their child, and to help the surrogate avoid attachment issues with the child – but the (well-intentioned) hospital staff overlooked both of these aspects. We (the parents) were supposed to be brought in as soon as the baby was born, for initial skin-to-skin contact, but the hospital staff didn’t bring us in until an hour after birth. Furthermore, they gave our surrogate first skin-to-skin contact – this promotes oxytocin in the surrogate, making it more difficult to part with the child, and denies the parents the opportunity for initial bonding. Worse, hospital staff kept referring to our surrogate as “mom”, and referred to our son by her last name. Not only is this disrespectful for the parents, but it makes separation even more difficult for the surrogate.</p>
</div>
<div id="contribution" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Contribution</h2>
<p>To me, contributing to inclusivity is about creating an inclusive environment, especially when it comes to making course content; calling out discrimination, even when the discrimination is unintentional; and being a role model for others by being comfortable about who I am.</p>
<div id="creating-an-inclusive-environment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Creating an inclusive environment</h3>
<p>There are a host of things we can do to create an inclusive environment.</p>
<p>We can change our language to be less presumptious. This means saying things such as “pregnant people” instead of “pregnant women”, referring to one’s “partner” instead of saying “wife” or “husband” (assuming a gender), not referring to someone by their race if not relevant (such as “I was talking to a Latino man the other day, …”), etc.</p>
<p>We can post online content that suggest inclusivity. For example, not using data in the classroom that indicates gender as binary (because it’s naive and ultimately untrue, even if gender is paraded as “sex”). Another example is not indicating female:male ratios and parading naive terms such as “gender balanced”, but rather indicating percentage belonging to a minority group (such as “percent self-identifying as female”) to show that we are sensitive to marginalized groups.</p>
<p>We can remove spaces that discriminate by gender. This means a complete decoupling of bathrooms and gender. UBC needs to first take low-hanging fruit by abolishing gender from single-person bathrooms (like we have in the stats dept). Then, the trickier issue of multi-person bathrooms can be addressed by finding the root problems (which at first seem gender-related, but are actually not), such as an overall lack of privacy in bathrooms.</p>
<p>We can include a “covenant” or “code of conduct” in collaborative online spaces. This explicitly states that discrimination won’t be tolerated.</p>
<p>We can pay attention to how we treat everyone, to avoid unconsious discimrination. This is important, but challenging. For example, I was once accused of spending less energy on non-native English speakers on Slack. Although it’s hard for us to recognize unconscious discrimination, I’m not convinced their claim was true – but regardless, this experience taught me that I need to be more deliberate about how I respond to students. I like to think, “how would I respond if this question or comment was made by someone else?”. This question is useful for interactions in the classroom, too.</p>
</div>
<div id="calling-out-discrimination" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Calling out discrimination</h3>
<p>Calling out discrimination means pointing out when non-inclusive language or behaviour is used, whether intentionally or not. Critically, this should be done with compassion, as opposed to accusation, because people may not know any better, and even if they do know better, this language can accidentally slip due to many years of belonging to a less-inclusive environment. Calling out discrimination can help educate people of the first type, as well as help re-program people of the second type. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone telling someone else that they’re in the “wrong bathroom” needs to be informed that they don’t know the person’s gender, nor does it matter.</li>
<li>A gay bar that has a “men only” policy needs to be told why it’s wrong.</li>
<li>A well-intentioned person celebrating “gender balance” needs to be informed as to why the term is non-inclusive to non-binary individuals.</li>
<li>A government that doesn’t allow dads to register their child needs to be written some letters as to why this is discriminatory.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, all of the above are situations I’ve encountered (and yes, I responded in each case).</p>
</div>
<div id="being-a-role-model" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> Being a Role Model</h3>
<p>I hope to be a role model by telling people that I identify as a gay cis-male (and no, the term “coming out” is not appropriate). Some examples of how I’ve done this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting my preferred personal pronouns (he/him/his) and a rainbow emoji online.</li>
<li>Posting a Positive Space sticker outside of my office.</li>
<li>Contributing my <a href="https://lgbtstem.wordpress.com/2019/11/09/an-interview-with-vincenzo-coia/">LGBTSTEM interview</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing this helps show that I’m proud of who I am, and indicates sensitivity to issues of gender and sexual identity. I hope this is empowering for others, as well as creating a safe space for students and others to talk about issues they may have with their identity. I also hope that it brings awareness to those who are not familiar with LGBTQ+ issues – for example, the more someone sees preferred personal pronouns being specified, the more likely they are to look up why more and more people are posting this and what this means.</p>
