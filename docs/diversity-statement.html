<p>To me, people deserve the same respect regardless of their identity. Any differential treatment is discrimination, and is problematic because it leaves people feeling disrespected, or worse, puts an impediment on one’s life.</p>
<p>Our society has made some great progress on inclusivity (the opposite of discrimination). Racial and sexual discrimination are significantly less these days compared to several decades ago. But the battle is still not over, as is evidenced by graffitied rainbow sidewalks and defaced mosques.</p>
<p>Some discrimination is still rife. Gender discrimination is one such example, which is now starting to see some progress. But there are still other types of discrimination that are not yet well known. One such example that I feel is happening is discrimination against fathers.</p>
<p>Not only is it healthy for each individual to receive respectful and equal treatment, we have so much to gain by having a diverse group of people around us. There’s strength in diversity.</p>
<p>The problem goes deeper and more elusive with the well-intentioned people who still discriminate unintentionally:</p>
<p>The problem does not necessarily lie with a discriminative response from an individual, if the response was unintentional. Despite the best of intentions, it’s our environment and society that is responsible for crafting an automatic response from an individual. So, a good-intentioned individual that does a double-take after seeing me and my male partner holding hands should not beat themselves up over it – it just means that the cumulative effect of their environment over time crafted such a response.</p>
<p>In the classroom, ensuring students all feel welcome, and feel that they can come talk to me, or participate in class. Fairness. Being mindful about whether I may be paying less attention to certain groups, for example, on Slack. I was once accused of spending less energy on non-native English speakers on Slack. Although it’s hard for us to recognize unconscious discrimination, I’m not convinced their claim was true – but regardless, this experience taught me that I need to be more deliberate about how I respond to students. I like to think, “how would I respond if this question or comment was made by someone else?”. I think the usefulness of this litmus test extends beyond Slack to general interactions with students.</p>
<ul>
<li>Staying mindful of the potential of subconscious discrimination coming about by showing preference of some team members over others, whether it be race, gender, personality, skillset, etc. This means being deliberate about where I spend my attention.</li>
</ul>
<div id="my-experience-with-discrimination" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> My experience with discrimination</h2>
<p>As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I continue to experience discrimination. Me and my male partner holding hands in public still forms a spectacle to many, some even stopping to watch us after we’ve walked by. Wedding vendors still referring to a “bride” when mentioning our wedding. Being invited to a wedding under the condition that my partner and I show no affection.</p>
<p>Things were worse in my adolescence, where homosexuality was “discouraged” in my environment, leaving me feeling socially out of place and fearful. Luckily, very few extended family members have a problem with my identity, and the rest embrace me.</p>
<p>Even though I’m a cis male, I’m quite passionate about gender issues, because they are largely not being embraced by our society, and because we’re all affected by it (although transgendered and non-binary people are affected on an entirely different level).</p>
<p>To me, any type of brainwashing is deplorable, yet gender brainwashing is ubiquitous. You won’t find a pink yoga mat in the men’s section.</p>
<p>pink</p>

<p>The solution to gender discrimination does not involve abolishing the notion of gender altogether, because gender has been proven to be important to humanity. Solution is about rather identifying a spectrum for which the extremes might be called “masculine” and “feminine”.</p>

<p>Fatherhood. Nice article on the bias: <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/families/mom-bias-in-the-parenting-community-why-is-there-no-discussion-about-it-wcz/" class="uri">https://goodmenproject.com/families/mom-bias-in-the-parenting-community-why-is-there-no-discussion-about-it-wcz/</a>
Nice article on involved dads reaching similar levels of oxytocin with involved moms: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/your-brain-fatherhood-dads-experience-hormonal-changes-too-research-shows-6C10333109" class="uri">https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/your-brain-fatherhood-dads-experience-hormonal-changes-too-research-shows-6C10333109</a>, which has one line that stands out when it comes to bias:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rilling said the study of the fatherhood effect is a “wide open frontier.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you may know, my partner and I recently had a child through surrogacy. But, on the delivery day, the hospital was not prepared to handle a situation with two dads. It’s important for the parents to form a bond with their child, and to help the surrogate avoid attachment issues with the child – but the (well-intentioned) hospital staff overlooked both of these aspects. We (the parents) were supposed to be brought in as soon as the baby was born, for initial skin-to-skin contact, but the hospital staff didn’t bring us in until an hour after birth. Furthermore, they gave our surrogate first skin-to-skin contact – this promotes oxytocin in the surrogate, making it more difficult to part with the child, and denies the parents the opportunity for initial bonding. Worse, hospital staff kept referring to our surrogate as “mom”, and referred to our son by her last name. Not only is this disrespectful for the parents, but it makes separation even more difficult for the surrogate.</p>
<p>In fact, there is an overarching issue of dads not being regarded as equally important figures as moms. Worse, this issue gets almost no attention. Moms are paraded as the caregivers, whereas dads are just there for support and don’t deserve much say in parenthood. Just about anything to do with parenthood refers to mom – for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>we could not find a book about parenthood that does not emphasize mom’s role;</li>
<li>parenthood groups emphasize women over men, such as Facebook groups and community centers.</li>
<li>marketing. Companies like 4Moms is akin to a business supply brand being called “4Businessmen”.</li>
<li>Even scientific research</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this hasn’t been socially recognized as an issue yet, in mentioning it, I risk sounding androcentric. This cannot be further from the truth. I recognize that women are far more marginalized than men are, and I fully embrace empowerment of women. Groups like R Ladies need support; I’m proud of the fact that we pay close attention to the amount of women we accept in the MDS program; and I’m no stranger to calling out</p>
<p>en though men are usually the priveledged</p>
</div>
<div id="contribution" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Contribution</h2>
<p>To me, contributing to inclusivity is about creating an inclusive environment, especially when it comes to making course content; calling out discrimination, even when the discrimination is unintentional; and being a role model for others by being comfortable about who I am.</p>
<div id="creating-an-inclusive-environment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Creating an inclusive environment</h3>
<p>Involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing our language to be less presumptious. This means saying things such as “pregnant people” instead of “pregnant women”, referring to one’s “partner” instead of saying “wife” or “husband” (assuming a gender), not referring to someone by their race if not relevant (such as “I was talking to a Latino man the other day, …”).</li>
<li>Posting online content that suggest inclusivity. For example, not using data that indicates gender as binary (because it’s naive and ultimately untrue, even if gender is paraded as “sex”), and not indicating female:male ratios and parading naive terms such as “gender balanced” (because that’s naive too), but rather indicating percentage belonging to a minority group (such as “percent self-identifying as female”).</li>
<li>Removing spaces that discriminate by gender – this means a complete decoupling of bathrooms and gender (one should never have to say “I’m not allowed in this room because I’m a man/woman”). UBC needs to first take low-hanging fruit by abolishing gender from single-person bathrooms (like we have in the stats dept), then focus on root issues of multi-person bathrooms (which at first seem gender-related, but are actually not), such as an overall lack of privacy.</li>
<li>Disassociating identities with career roles.</li>
<li>Including a “covenant” or “code of conduct” in collaborative (and student) projects.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="calling-out-discrimination" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Calling out discrimination</h3>
<p>Means pointing out when non-inclusive language or behaviour is used, whether intentionally or not. Critically, this should be done with compassion, as opposed to accusation, because (1) people may not know any better, and (2) even if they do know better, this language can accidentally slip due to many years of belonging to a less-inclusive environment. Calling out discrimination can help educate people of the first type, as well as help re-program people of the second type. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone telling someone else that they’re in the “wrong bathroom”.</li>
<li>Example with MDS website, and bringing up issues in our academic meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Coming out” tells others that I’m proud of who I am, but also indicates sensitivity to issues of gender and sexual identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting my preferred personal pronouns (he/him/his) and a rainbow emoji online.</li>
<li>Posting a Positive Space sticker outside of my office.</li>
<li>Contributing my <a href="https://lgbtstem.wordpress.com/2019/11/09/an-interview-with-vincenzo-coia/">LGBTSTEM interview</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this, I’m hoping that others can feel safer around me, and that I inspire others to have pride in who they are as well. I also hope that it brings awareness to those who are not familiar with LGBTQ+ issues – for example, the more someone sees preferred personal pronouns being specified, the more likely they are to look up why more and more people are posting this and what this means.</p>
<p>[ ] sensitivity to marginalized groups; embracing diversity.</p>

<div id="letter-to-bc-vital-stats" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Letter to BC Vital Stats:</h2>
<p>I’m writing to bring awareness and hopefully encourage change to the discriminative policies regarding birth registration. I’ve come across the following issues (most of which are at <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/birth-adoption/births/birth-registration" class="uri">https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/birth-adoption/births/birth-registration</a>):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A dad is not allowed to register his child’s birth on his own, but a mom can.</li>
<li>A dad is not allowed to apply for MSP and Canada Child Benefits, but a mom can.</li>
<li>A dad is not allowed to be listed as primary caregiver without getting permission from the mom (if present), but a mom can list herself without permission of a present dad.</li>
</ol>
<p>This tells dads that they are only of secondary importance when it comes to child care, promoting a culture whereby dads don’t connect as intimately to their children. It also harms women’s ability to establish an equal presence in the workforce as men, due to the expectation that men need not expend as much energy on their child as women.</p>
<p>Even the notion of “primary caregiver” is discriminatory. Asking to identify such an individual is equivalent to asking “which parent is going to give less care to their child?”, which is of course very presumptuous, but also promotes a culture of unequal parenting, putting more pressure on one individual.</p>
<p>Lastly, this is non-inclusive of the situation where there’s no mom (i.e., two dads), nor the situation where individuals don’t squarely identify as either male or female. Even if BC policy does allow for these cases, these individuals can’t just follow the “normal” procedures – this is differential treatment, and therefore discrimination.</p>
<p>I implore you to modify BC’s policies so that gender is not relevant when it comes to child care, and to consider the fact that more than one parent can be “primary” when it comes to providing care. Not only would it help our culture in BC, but BC would act as a world leader in this front, inspiring others to follow suit.</p>
