**NOTE: THIS APPLICATION IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS**

Dear members of the search committee,

I am writing to enthusiastically apply for a tenure-track instructor position in Statistics ([Job #35876](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/three-tenure-track-instructor-positions-statistics-35876)). Ever since joining the department of Statistics full time in early 2017 to advance our Data Science initiatives, I've come to realize just how ideal of a fit the teaching stream is for me. My aim with this application is to indicate why this is so, as well as why the department and UBC (and external to UBC!) would benefit by promoting me to the teaching stream.

Ultimately, in this position, I envision advancing all branches of Data Science education at UBC, especially through Statistics for Data Science. I'm equally excited to develop the new Minor in Data Science program as I am to continue developing the Master of Data Science (MDS) program. In fact, I'm actually rather torn between the two: there is still much to develop with MDS, and I'm rather invested in the program; but the allure of developing a new Minor program is a new equally exciting challenge that I can make valuable contributions to. Regardless of my level of involvement in these, I intend to keep an open stream of communication between the two programs, along with STAT 545A/547M, so that data science education at UBC can overall grow as a cohesive whole, as opposed to competing pieces. 

My vision for doing this 

I've identified four pillars of my career, which I hope will lay the foundation for my vision going forward in the teaching stream, as well as convey fit on my end. They are, in order of culmination:

1. __Application__: addressing real problems with data science.

This means continuing to work with external partners, such as the Master of Data Science (MDS) capstone partners, to understand their pressing data issues, and lend a hand once in a while. This is important for keeping myself and data science education at UBC relevant, as well as continually expanding my skillset. Besides having mentored MDS capstone projects for the past three years, I also did some work on flood forecasting with BGC Engineering this past summer. 

2. __Research__: discovering better ways to do data science.

I've come to learn that there is a deficit in figuring out how to apply Statistics to a real problem. Statistical Science (importantly) is generally about setting up a framework of stochastic assumptions, and describing properties and methods under this framework. An example of a framework is linear regression; another, a Markov model. But the reality is that real examples don't neatly satisfy assumptions. Instead, some assumptions are better _approximations_ than others, yet others have different _uses_ than others. Thinking about assumptions in this respect brings about questions and ways of thinking that have traditionally not been adequately addressed in the literature nor the classroom, yet are defining for Statistics for Data Science -- hence why I think of this as "research". I call this approach a "problem-first" approach, as opposed to a "method-first" approach taken by Statistical Science. Even Applied Statistics may seem to take a "problem-first" approach, but the motivating real-world problem tends to be used as motivation for setting up a framework of assumptions, for which properties are then described.

I've been developing this way of thinking with MDS, but am nowhere near complete. I wish to continue this approach throughout my career.

On a smaller scale, I find that distributional thinking needs improvement. To this extent, I am developing an R package that works with distributions as objects, as opposed to handling the unwieldly pieces of functions like `dnorm()` and `rnbinom()`. My goal is to submit this package to CRAN and ROpenSci, and perhaps grab the attention of RStudio and the `tidymodels` team. Furthermore, I believe that copulas are currently not accessible enough due to complicated formulas and jargon, yet are tremendously useful for distributional forecasting. I hope to make this framework more accessible by developing an R package called `coperate` and `cmc` for easy manipulation of copulas, and easily created copula-based models (respectively). Again, submitted to CRAN and ROpenSci. 

3. __Development__: turning new research into programs and tools, which are ideally accessible to the public.
4. __Teaching__: spreading data literacy and enthusiasm to the public.




- excellence in, and commitment to, undergraduate teaching; 
- ability to work collaboratively as well as independently, and to supervise the work of others;
- promise of educational leadership at UBC and nationally or internationally;
- potential for creating innovative instructional environments.

<!-- Experience with evidence-based teaching methods, curriculum development, course design, and other initiatives that advance the universityâ€™s ability to excel in its teaching and learning mandate is also an asset.  -->

<!-- Candidates motivated to innovate around the teaching of both core statistical topics (e.g., estimation, hypothesis testing) and more nascent data science topics (e.g., visualization, data wrangling, transparent and reproducible workflows) are particularly attractive. -->

Lastly, I'd like to elaborate on how my skills will be an asset to the department. 

Excitement and promise for starting up the minor program, helping MDS and STAT 545A/547M evolve along with it.

hyperlinks to one or two examples of my teaching materials. Note that I don't see any of these as being "finished", but rather a work-in-progress.

- For STAT 545A/547M (Exploratory Data Analysis), I made the [lecture notes](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.com/) and [course website](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/). Less relevant are Lectures 11+, taught by Dr. Firas Moosvi, and Lecture 6, a guest lecture taught by my TA, Victor Yuan.
- For DSCI 551 (Probability for Data Science), I wrote the [lecture notes](https://ubc-mds.github.io/DSCI_551_stat-prob-dsci/lectures/) by using Dr. Mike Gelbart's notes from the previous year as scaffolding.
- I'm writing an open-source book on regression analysis for data science, called [Interpreting Regression](https://interpreting-regression.netlify.com/). It's in its early stages.

What I'm comfortable teaching (useful in parallel to the minor program in DS)

Tools; my comfort level with CS. Although I don't have formal training in CS outside of perhaps a few undergraduate courses, my approach to learning these things is to identify tools and techniques that would be useful, and commit to building these tools. I prefer this approach over prescribed training such as online courses, because I find it more genuine as I encounter concepts as they become relevant. For example, I've been learning web hosting as I've been learning about Hugo, blogdown, and netlify to create websites like my homepage, course websites like STAT 545A/547M, and hosting "books" such as Interpreting Regression online. I've learned shell scripting back in my PhD, and continue to learn more, as I embrace GNU Make and workflow automation in general. 

Teaching tools and methods

the names of three references who have been asked to send reference letters:

1. Dr. Tiffany Timbers (current supervisor)
2. Dr. Michael Gelbart (current supervisor)
3. Dr. Harry Joe (PhD supervisor)

I am eager to begin the position on the indicated July 1, 2020 start date, but am ultimately flexible. 

Enthusiastically yours,

Dr. Vincenzo Coia
