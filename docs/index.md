# Cover Letter

**NOTE: THIS APPLICATION IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS**

Dear members of the search committee,

I am writing to enthusiastically apply for a tenure-track instructor position in Statistics ([Job #35876](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/three-tenure-track-instructor-positions-statistics-35876)). Ever since joining the department of Statistics full time in early 2017 to advance our Data Science initiatives, I've come to realize just how ideal of a fit the educational leadership stream is for me. My aim with this application is to indicate why this is so, as well as why the department and UBC (and external to UBC!) would benefit by promoting me to the educational leadership stream.

Ultimately, in this position, I envision advancing all branches of Data Science education at UBC, especially through Statistics for Data Science. I'm equally excited to develop the new Minor in Data Science program as I am to continue developing the Master of Data Science (MDS) program. In fact, I'm actually rather torn between the two: there is still much to develop with MDS, and I'm rather invested in the program; but the allure of developing a new Minor program is a new equally exciting challenge that I can make valuable contributions to. Regardless of my level of involvement in these, I intend to keep an open stream of communication between the two programs, along with STAT 545A/547M, so that data science education at UBC can overall grow as a cohesive whole, as opposed to competing pieces. 

My vision for doing this 

I've identified four pillars of my career, which I hope will lay the foundation for my vision going forward in the teaching stream, as well as convey fit on my end. They are, in order of culmination:

1. __Application__: addressing real problems with data science.


2. __Research__: discovering better ways to do data science.
3. __Development__: turning new research into programs and tools, which are ideally accessible to the public.
4. __Teaching__: spreading data literacy and enthusiasm to the public.


Lastly, I'd like to elaborate on how my skills will be an asset to the department. 

Excitement and promise for starting up the minor program, helping MDS and STAT 545A/547M evolve along with it.

hyperlinks to one or two examples of my teaching materials. Note that I don't see any of these as being "finished", but rather a work-in-progress.

- For STAT 545A/547M (Exploratory Data Analysis), I made the [lecture notes](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.com/) and [course website](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/). Less relevant are Lectures 11+, taught by Dr. Firas Moosvi, and Lecture 6, a guest lecture taught by my TA, Victor Yuan.
- For DSCI 551 (Probability for Data Science), I wrote the [lecture notes](https://ubc-mds.github.io/DSCI_551_stat-prob-dsci/lectures/) by using Dr. Mike Gelbart's notes from the previous year as scaffolding.
- I'm writing an open-source book on regression analysis for data science, called [Interpreting Regression](https://interpreting-regression.netlify.com/). It's in its early stages.

What I'm comfortable teaching (useful in parallel to the minor program in DS)

Tools; my comfort level with CS. Although I don't have formal training in CS outside of perhaps a few undergraduate courses, my approach to learning these things is to identify tools and techniques that would be useful, and commit to building these tools. I prefer this approach over prescribed training such as online courses, because I find it more genuine as I encounter concepts as they become relevant. For example, I've been learning web hosting as I've been learning about Hugo, blogdown, and netlify to create websites like my homepage, course websites like STAT 545A/547M, and hosting "books" such as Interpreting Regression online. I've learned shell scripting back in my PhD, and continue to learn more, as I embrace GNU Make and workflow automation in general. 

Teaching tools and methods

the names of three references who have been asked to send reference letters:

1. Dr. Tiffany Timbers (current supervisor)
2. Dr. Michael Gelbart (current supervisor)
3. Dr. Harry Joe (PhD supervisor)

I am eager to begin the position on the indicated July 1, 2020 start date, but am ultimately flexible. 

Enthusiastically yours,

Dr. Vincenzo Coia
