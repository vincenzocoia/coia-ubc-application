<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<!-- must provide evidence for excellence in, and commitment to, undergraduate teaching;  -->
<!-- must provide evidence for potential for creating innovative instructional environments.  -->
<!-- I imagine this section to be on how I go about teaching -->
<p>My philosophy on teaching can best be broken down into four categories: <strong>appropriate course structure</strong>, <strong>responsive teaching</strong>, <strong>motivation</strong>, and <strong>self-improvement</strong>.</p>
<div id="appropriate-structure" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Appropriate Structure</h3>
<p>You and I don’t really know English. We only know enough for it to be a sufficiently useful tool for our own daily activities. I take this concept to heart as I design and deliver my courses. It’s fallacious to design a course around <em>topics</em>, but rather on building <em>skills</em> for a certain purpose. To me, these skills formulated as a list of <strong>learning objectives</strong> (LO’s) act as a “true north” that all components of a course point towards, and are the most important structure to the course. For example, course content on the topic “heteroskedasticity” could be developed in many directions. The students, thinking they have to “know heteroskedasticity”, get stuck studying its never-ending scope. Instead, a learning objective such as “modify a linear model to appropriately incorporate heteroskedasticity based on data diagnostics” provides direction for the teaching team to create material, and clarity for the students. For concrete examples, take a look at <a href="https://ubc-mds.github.io/DSCI_551_stat-prob-dsci/lectures/">the DSCI 551 notes</a>, or my other course materials.</p>
<p>Clarity about the course structure and expectations is important for equipping students with a map of what they need to do to succeed. In addition to discussing how students should use the LO’s, describing the summative assessments and a course syllabus is also important, as well as making it easy to navigate course material (see, for example, the <a href="https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/">STAT 545A/547M syllabus website</a>). Informing the students of any changes or of any mistakes, no matter how painful, is also critical for maintaining clarity.</p>
</div>
<div id="responsive-teaching" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Responsive teaching</h3>
<p>Too much structure can stymie a course. This is because, while preparing course material, the instructor is not truly equipped with the clarity of how to most appropriately deliver material until the material has been delivered. For example, a question for the class might have seemed insightful when it was being prepared, but maybe during class the question doesn’t end up being insightful. Or, maybe the lecture delivery time was underestimated. The answer to addressing this issue is responsive teaching.</p>
<p>Responsive teaching to me is about staying in touch with the class to get a feel for areas that need more or less attention. For example, it means: taking a break when the energy of the class is low; responding to class confusion by explaining something in a different way on the whiteboard; or spending more or less time on something after realizing its importance mid-class. In this way, teaching is more akin to improv comedy, where actors must respond to random cues from the audience (I’ve taken lessons). I believe in embracing a mindset of letting go and trusting in yourself to respond appropriately the moment things go off course, and to also be humble and admit when you don’t know something. This type of spontaneity sometimes also requires realizing and appropriately acting on your agency in adapting a course on the fly. Understanding that a course is flexible allows you to be nimble during contact hours with students, as opposed to feeling stuck in delivering the course exactly as it was originally laid out. However, it’s important to be strategic when making changes so that things remain orderly and as seemless as possible for the students, and to be clear about any changes made. I like using the start of class to check in and return to a roadmap of the course so that everyone remains on board a moving bus.</p>
<p>Contact time with students is critical for adapting my teaching to the students, and provides tremendous value for students to actually enrol in a program as opposed to taking an online course. Perhaps the most effective method for doing this is making a point to engage with each student in lab. Equally as powerful are discussion-style office hours. I no longer hold my office hours in my office, because the office hour model whereby students just drop by to ask a question is just not effective. There ends up being a queue of students, usually asking common questions, and these students feel pressured to leave the office so that others can get a turn. Instead, I hold my office hours in a lab-like room suitable for collaboration. I end up leading a whole-group discussion prompted by student questions. This gives me even more insight as to how things are going in class, and allows me the opportunity to modify the course moving forward or make clarifications.</p>
<p>Some other methods for connecting with the students are:</p>
<ul>
<li>being present on the course Slack channel (and sometimes even other course channels) to provide more insight,</li>
<li>sending out a 1-minute long early survey about how the course is going,</li>
<li>taking the time to talk to students who approach me during the mid-class break or after class,</li>
<li>pausing to ask questions and check for insight in the classroom,</li>
<li>applying active learning strategies such as think-pair-share or live coding, and</li>
<li>checking in to see how things are going at the start of each class, by asking questions like “how are we feeling about the quiz coming up next week”, or “how are we feeling this week”.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Motivation</h3>
<p>Neither structure nor responsive teaching will suffice if the students don’t know the reason for discussing the course material.</p>
<p>I take to heart what I learned from Greg Wilson, that teaching is much more about motivating students than it is knowledge transfer. Students have access to any information they want through the internet, but a classroom environment has the powerful advantage of the presence of peers and an engaging instructor. On the teaching front, this means being enthusiastic, and focussing on why they should care about the things I talk about. It also means being aware of the lengthy (usually 80-minute) time frame that students are present for (and that’s just for one class), by taking a break mid-class, returning to the big-picture, and providing additional instructions for exercises for people who may have “fallen off the bus”. I’m pleased that I regularly receive ample praise on my instructor evaluations, and I encourage you to take a look.</p>
</div>
<div id="self-improvement" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> Self-Improvement</h3>
<p>What’s better than effective teaching? Teaching that continually becomes more effective.</p>
<p>Community engagement is one method to become a better teacher. This means keeping an open dialogue and sharing experiences with other teachers, especially my colleagues. Aside from simple acts like sharing ideas and experiences through Slack and gatherings, I’m proud that my team gives and receives formative feedback on our teaching by visiting each others’ lectures. I also take the opportunity to partake in workshops, such as UBC’s Instructional Skills Workshop, and MDS’s annual workshop on Data Science education.</p>
<p>An after-action review is another effective method, involving capturing the insight you gain after teaching. There are three ways I engage in an after-action review. First, I capture regular insight throughout the delivery of the course as GitHub Issues, so that the insight can easily be referred to in the future and by any of my colleagues. Secondly, I find keeping a teaching journal that’s not tied to a specific course is useful for becoming a better teacher in general – and it’s even easier now that my team has our lectures recorded. Thirdly, my colleagues and I engage in a “retreat” at the end of each term, to discuss our insight on our courses and the MDS program as a whole.</p>
<p>Realizing one’s own struggles is also critical for self-improvement. For now, one thing I struggle with are student names. I feel embarrassed to use names because I’m sure to make mistakes, but calling students by their name is important because it shows that the instructor cares. I already review class lists, but have been stepping outside of my comfort zone by no longer avoiding using names. Another thing I struggle with is writing in an orderly fashion on the whiteboard. I use the whiteboard for spontaneity / responsive teaching, which means I don’t know how I’ll ultimately be using the board throughout the class. I end up running out of space, and end up using the board in a non-linear fashion, which can sometimes be confusing. For now, I intend to remain mindful of this and keep practicing.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Training Philosophy</h2>
<!-- must provide evidence for ability to work collaboratively as well as independently, and to supervise the work of others -->
<!-- Note to self: I think the work I mention elsewhere in my application acts as evidence for the ability to work independently -->
<p>When it comes to training, I aim to foster a clear and highly communicative environment between me and my trainees.</p>
<p>Examples of group leadership include the development and delivery of courses with colleagues and teaching assistants, and the delivery of capstone projects together with partner organizations and student groups with MDS. I believe effective group leadership involves establishing everyone’s roles, expectations, and time commitments; creating an empowering work culture for all group members; and defining success. When training is involved, delegation and feedback are key to promote the subordinate’s growth.</p>
<p>Clarifying each team member’s role, expectations, and level of authority for making decisions is the beginning step in defining a framework for which the group can operate effectively. Doing so allows everyone to respect each other’s time and boundaries, so that group members know how to interact with each other. The MDS Capstone projects are one example, where I feel it is tremendously important to immediately clarify the roles of the student group, the partner organization, and myself, so that problems don’t arise such as the partner organization treating the students like employees. Another example is having established roles at the beginning our DSCI 561 redevelopment kickoff meeting, involving a graduate assistant to be the main one putting “pen to paper”, myself as her mentor, and colleagues for checking in with the high-level direction of the redevelopment.</p>
<p>When it comes to the actual nature of the interactions between group members and myself, I believe it’s important to empower all group members to feel some ownership over the project that they can make a valuable contribution to. The reality is that everyone has a unique set of skills that, when tapped, result in a better end product than I could have produced on my own. Doing this means to be deliberate about my interactions – it means bringing positive and friendly energy, being aware of my facial expression, and considering all input and ideas as if they are thoughtful. Setting up the environment like this also helps create a culture that’s safe for dissent, which also involves asking everyone to feel comfortable to disagree with others. It’s also important to show every member respect, for example, by treating them as if their time is valuable, such as by allowing them to meet either electronically or in person (if appropriate). Finally, it’s important to show gratitude and to sometimes just stop and marvel at what has been created.</p>
<p>When it comes to the actual teaching and training of my trainees, it’s important to provide regular input both verbally and as written feedback. This involves taking the time to write detailed notes as to where they can improve or where they are exceeding expectations. For example, my capstone groups know that I will give them the courtesy of looking into the details of their work and give them detailed feedback. This is more time consuming than just skimming over their work and providing a few comments, but this is what promotes learning.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of training is to delegate, especially when it comes to those tasks that we as leaders feel more skilled at. This is difficult, because we feel ownership over our tasks. We feel that we are in the best position to do the job, and we gain the satisfaction when they are done. But we must let go, and “gift” these tasks to our trainees who are less skilled at it, because the challenge it presents them is a powerful learning opportunity. Of course, this doesn’t mean gifting and walking away. As mentioned, regular feedback is important. For example, I like to give my teaching assistants the opportunity to teach up to one lecture for most courses that I teach. I provide guidance leading up to the lecture, and afterwards, I like to walk with them outdoors and allow them to tell me how they think the lecture went. I find that simply lending an ear and asking questions provides the space for reflection and learning, and I hear how valuable this experience is for them.</p>
<p>Finally, as in teaching, I always looking for ways to improve my leadership in training. This involves asking the uncomfortable question of how I’m doing as a leader. For me, as I learned from last year’s capstone project, I need to be more mindful of group dynamics. Even if things between me and each team member or student is fine, the relationship between other team members might not be. This year, I’ll be meeting with each student individually early on to see how things are going.</p>
