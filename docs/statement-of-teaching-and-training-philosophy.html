<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Teaching</h2>
<!-- must provide evidence for excellence in, and commitment to, undergraduate teaching;  -->
<!-- I imagine this section to be on how I go about teaching -->
<p>My teaching takes to heart what I learned from Greg Wilson, that teaching is much more about motivating students than it is knowledge transfer. Students have access to any information they want through the internet, but a classroom environment has the powerful advantage of the presence of peers and a knowledgeable instructor. I take a semi-spontaneous approach to teaching, as inspired by improv comedy – I have a rough guideline that I abide to, but am not afraid to deviate from this where necessary, responding to how the class is feeling about a topic. I use various methods to keep constant awareness of how the class is feeling, through simple methods such as asking questions, to more modern active learning strategies such as think-pair-share, which leverages the knowledge of peers.</p>
<p>I believe in quality over quantity, and this is especially important for a program as time-sensitive as the Master of Data Science program at UBC that I currently teach in. Here, I focus on fundamental concepts, asking the question “what must the students absolutely know by the end of this course?” To help answer this, I look to fundamental concepts <em>as they relate to applications</em>, not necessarily how they are developed in academia. I stick to these core concepts, and show students just how far they can go by exploring deeper concepts and data science methods – again, going back to motivation over knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>I believe that teaching is far less effective when done “in a vacuum”, as opposed to collaboratively with the input and feedback from peers. I’m lucky to be involved with open and communicative colleagues who can share their input, to build world-class courses in data science. And I’m happy to be on the other end as well, providing input and feedback to my colleagues.</p>
<p>[ ] Learning objectives to guide content creation, lab creation, and quiz creation.
[ ] problem-first approach when teaching data science
[ ] Responsive teaching (address points of confusion that I notice from slack and labs in lecture; dont bother with think pair share if the answers are unanimous.)
[ ] Clearly defining expectations, and clearly and constantly reminding everyone what we’ve talked about and why regardingthe big structure of the course.</p>
<p>One thing I struggle with are student names. I feel embarrassed to use names because I’m sure to make mistakes, some probably quite embarrassing. But calling students by their name is important because it shows that the instructor cares. I already review class lists, but intend to take this one step further by no longer avoiding using names.</p>

<div id="training" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Training</h2>
<!-- must provide evidence for ability to work collaboratively as well as independently, and to supervise the work of others -->
<ul>
<li>Respecting people’s time: giving subordinates the option of meeting electronically if they choose.</li>
<li>Making clear everyone’s role in a team project (example: 561 project, capstone projects)</li>
<li>and getting a sense of the amount of time/involvement each person will be contributing.</li>
<li>Delegation levels, and being open to letting go (sometimes it’s difficult because we want to take ownership)</li>
<li>Staying mindful of the potential of subconscious discrimination coming about by showing preference of some team members over others, whether it be race, gender, personality, skillset, etc. This means being deliberate about where I spend my attention.</li>
<li>Feedback: taking the time to provide feedback for one’s work. I believe this shows respect for the other person, that they are worth my time, and provides an impetus for them to improve. Example: 561 labs 3 and 4 with Tom; detailed feedback on pieces of writing submitted by students (capstone).</li>
<li>I try to be genuine so that they can see that I’m also a human that makes mistakes and has gaps in my skillset, and lead a regular life outside of UBC. I think this also helps develop a stream of open communication for questions, concerns, and how things are going. Creating a culture that’s safe for dissent, because my subordinates have skills, knowledge, and a viewpoint that I don’t have, and from which I can learn from them.</li>
<li>One thing I need to improve upon for this coming capstone, as reflected in my evaluations, is to be more mindful of group dynamics. Even if things between me and each team member/student are fine, relationships between other team members/students might not be. This year, I’ll be meeting with each student individually to see how things are going.</li>
