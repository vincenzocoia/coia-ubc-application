## Teaching Strategy (<= 30 min)

Topic: sampling distribution of the sample mean

Here is a description of how I would teach the material.

> Prerequisite knowledge. Clarify the prerequisite knowledge that you expect the students to know before they engage with the topic.

- Generating data from a population distribution.
- How to calculate the sample mean.
- The concept of a sample mean vs. the true mean (we've so far put aside the question of "how good" the sample mean is when estimating the true mean).

> Learning outcomes. Describe some learning outcomes you would want your students
to be able to attain on the topic by the end of the course.

From this lecture, students are expected to be able to:

- Describe the difference between a sampling distribution and a population distribution.
- Use a sampling distribution to construct confidence intervals.
- Describe what happens to the sampling distribution of the mean as the sample size $n$ grows.
- Estimate the sampling distribution from a univariate sample using asymptotics and bootstrapping.
- Describe what happens to the shape of the sampling distribution of the mean as the sample size $n$ grows. 
- Use the `rsample` R package to obtain bootstrap samples.

**Hint**: Use these learning objectives when studying for your exam. 

> Difficulties students might have learning the topic. What difficulties would you
expect students to have when they engage with this topic?

> Student engagement and learning. Describe how you would engage the students with
the topic. How would you assist them in attaining your learning outcomes? Your
discussion can involve activities both in and out of scheduled class time.

> Technology. What, if any, learning technologies can assist in the learning of the
topic?

> Assessment. How would you assess studentsâ€™ attainment of your learning outcomes
for this topic? Describe examples of both formative and summative assessment you
may use.
